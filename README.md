##  Contributing

### Team Conventions

This package is co-maintained by all front-end developers at [La Javaness](https://www.lajavaness.com). Each contribution must follow established conventions.

We ensure consistent code formatting with [Prettier](https://prettier.io), code quality with [ESLint](https://eslint.org), and commit message formatting with [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org).

Incoming code must not cause existing tests to fail; that rule is enforced with a precommit hook.

Code should be pushed to a ``feature/*`` or ``fix/*`` branch based on the type of change made, and a Pull Request made against the next branch. A fellow developer must approve the PR before it can be merged.

### Commits

#### Formatting
The project uses [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release) to upgrade, document and deploy its NPM package, and [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org) to ensure all commit messages are understood by semantic-release.

Please read the [upstream documentation](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/#commit-message-format) to understand the enforced format. Below is an excerpt for quick reference:

| Commit message                                                     | Release type             |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------|
| fix(pencil): Stop graphite breaking when too much pressure applied | Patch Release            |
| docs(README): Append a `Use graphite properly` section to README   | Patch Release            |
| refactor: Improve 'graphiteWidth' option                           | Patch Release            |
| style: Remove all semi-colons                                      | Patch Release            |
| feat(pencil): Add 'graphiteWidth' option                           | (Minor) Feature Release  |
| perf(pencil): Remove graphiteWidth option                          | (Major) Breaking Release |
| BREAKING CHANGE: The graphiteWidth option has been removed.        | (Major) Breaking Release |

Below is the meaning of the different commit prefixes:

- ``feat``: (new feature for a component or new component)
- ``fix``: (bug fix in a component)
- ``docs``: (changes to the documentation)
- ``style``: (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
- ``refactor``: (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
- ``test``: (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no code change)
- ``perf``: (changes to code for performance reasons)
- ``chore``: (updating yarn tasks, CI pipelines, build scripts, etc; no code change)

#### Precommit Hooks

Both ``test:ci`` and ``prettier`` commands are run before each commit to ensure the code remains well-formatted and tested.

Ensure the `.git/hooks/pre-commit`` file is present in your repository.

The ``yarn prettier`` command used by pre-commit hooks automatically fixes style issues and stages any unstaged content into your commit, to make sure those style changes are staged. This prevents the use of partial commits. If you want to commit only part of your changed files, you can ``stash`` unstaged code before committing. This is the preferred way of doing things at La Javaness.
